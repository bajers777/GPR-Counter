## About The Project

![Screenshot](/screenshot1.png)
Since I work additionally doing road traffic measurements, I've created simple counter-like application to help myself and my colleagues.
<br />
I know how making traffic surveys can be hard and arduous, especially when you work eight or ten hours a day in normal work. Thats why I always look for better and easier ways to make as much surveys as possible. Work smart ~~not~~ **AND** hard!

Main user assumptions:
* User is able to count in 15 minutes intervals,
* Result can be copy and paste to templete Excel file,
* User have always access to counted surveys,
* User can't modify once done survey,

##### not yet implemented feature

> Main admin assumptions:
> - First of all - be able to manage surveys, assign movies to user, send notifications,
> - Can create and manage user account,
